Sculpin takes plain old text files (Markdown, Textile, etc.) and combines
them with Twig templates to produce a set of static HTML files that can
be easily deployed to almost any hosting platform.

Documentation
-------------

Sculpin has [documentation](https://sculpin.io/documentation/) but also is "learn by example". If you are interested in trying out Sculpin you should fire
up a Sculpin skeleton site to see Sculpin in action.


Sculpin Skeletons
-----------------

Skeletons are starting points for a new Sculpin based site. While not strictly
required (you can always start a site from scratch) using a skeleton is a good
way to get a bunch of structure in place with little or no effort.

Unless otherwise noted, the following skeletons are **barebones**. They will have
minimal styles (if any at all) and are not intended to be pretty. You are
expected to add all of the style magic yourself.

   A very basic Sculpin based blog.

Not Invented Here
-----------------

There are other fine projects from which Sculpin has been inspired. Many are
more mature than this one. If you are looking for a stable project with an
established community, try something on the following admittedly incomplete
list:

 * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) &mdash; Ruby
 * [Octopress](http://octopress.org) &mdash; Ruby (framework on top of Jekyll)
 * [Hyde](http://hyde.github.io/) &mdash; Python
 * [Phrozn](https://github.com/Pawka/phrozn) &mdash; PHP
 * [Pie Crust](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/PieCrust) &mdash; PHP
 * [Pie Crust 2](http://bolt80.com/piecrust) &mdash; Python
